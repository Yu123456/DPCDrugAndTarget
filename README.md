# Drug-target interaction data cluster analysis based on improving density peaks clustering algorithm
DPCDrugAndTarget is a density-based clustering algorithm to drug-target data proposed by Donghua Yu, Maozu Guo, et al. in 2018. See our paper submitted to **IDA 2018**.

### Paper information
 Maozu Guo, Donghua Yu et al. Drug-target interaction data cluster analysis based on improving density peaks clustering algorithm. 2018.

### Code and Data
quick start:
- Run 'DPCSeq.m': clustering artificial or real-world datasets
- Run 'DPCSeqE.m': clustering artificial or real-world datasets and obtaining evaluation
- Run 'DTDPCSqe.m': clustering drug or target dataset

**Note:** Please change the dataset path in these code.
